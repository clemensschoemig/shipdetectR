# shipdetectR

**shipdetectR** is an R package for detecting ships in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery.

It uses brightness thresholding, spatial clustering and geometric bounding toisolate potential vessels on open water.

It Supports Sentinel-1 data and uses shapefiles to mask land.


## Installation

Install from GitHub:

```r
devtools::install_github("clemensschoemig/shipdetectR")
```


## How it works

The ship detection process performs the following steps:

1. Water Masking – Crops SAR raster to water areas using a shapefile.

2. Thresholding – Flags bright pixels above mean + 1.5 × SD as potential ship pixels.

3. Clustering – Groups neighboring bright pixels in a moving window.

4. Filtering – Removes clusters with fewer than N pixels.

5. Counting – Labels and counts each ship-like cluster.

6. Bounding Boxes – Generates rectangular bounding boxes around each ship.

7. Centroid Export – Exports ship center points as a shapefile.

Each step can also be executed by the main detect_all_ships() function or step by step by using the individual functions.



## Example Output

![Detected ships](man/figures/ship_detection_output.png)



## Quick Start

The main function `detect_all_ships()` makes it easy to run the full workflow in a single call.
The package includes a built-in example raster and waterbody shapefile.

```r
library(shipdetectR)

results <- detect_all_ships(
  raster_path = system.file("extdata", "package_basis_subset_TC_vh_intensity.tif", package = "shipdetectR"),
  water_shapefile_path = system.file("extdata", "iho.shp", package = "shipdetectR"),
  output_path = tempfile(fileext = ".shp"), # Temporary output
  #output_path = "C:/your_filepath/ship_centroids.shp", # OR: Save results permanently
  export = TRUE,
  plot_results = TRUE
)
```

## Documentation

You can access documentation for each function using the standard `?` syntax in R:

```r
?detect_all_ships
?mask_to_water
```


## Sample Data

The package includes a Sentinel-1 test raster and a water mask for testing:

```
raster_path <- system.file("extdata", "package_basis_subset_TC_vh_intensity.tif", package = "shipdetectR")
shapefile_path <- system.file("extdata", "iho.shp", package = "shipdetectR")
```

The example dataset is based on Sentinel-1 imagery that was terrain-corrected using the SNAP software.
